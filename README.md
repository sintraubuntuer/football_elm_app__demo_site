##  Football-Info-Elm-App Frontend site 

site that illustrates the functioning of the football info elm app .
source code here : https://github.com/sintraubuntuer/football-info-elm-app 


This was published for the first time several years ago and was initially coupled with a django-rest api and postgres db.
both hosted on a ( at the time ) free hosting site. Unfortunately that site altered it's policy and decided to start charging 
so I decided to make it a simple static site ( with just some virtual data at the moment ) ...


Tell me what you think and if possible help improve the code ( that's what open source is all about ;)  )
